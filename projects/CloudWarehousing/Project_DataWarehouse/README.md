# Data Warehousing on Amazon Web Services

## Project Summary

1. A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. We need to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. 

### Project Goals

   - [x] Load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift
   - [x] Execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables

## Files in this repository

- `dwh.cfg` - contains host info: Redshift cluster & Database in AWS  
- `sql_queries.py` - contains SQL statements used for the following ETL steps: 
    - `create_tables.py` - contains instructions to create Redshift tables
    - `etl.py` -  contains instructions to populate tables with data from JSON files


### Info about datasets

1. **Song_Dataset**: This is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID, e.g., `song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json`. Example song in a json contains the following key and value pairs:  
   
    | key | value |  
    | :---: |  :---: |  :---: | 
    | num_songs | 1|
    | artist_id | "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7" |
    | artist_latitude | null | 
    | artist_longitude | null |
    | artist_location | "" |
    | artist_name | "Line Renaud" |
    | song_id | "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1" |
    | title | "Der Kleine Dompfaff" | 
    | duration | 152.92036 |
    | year | 0 |

2. **Log_Dataset**: This dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings. Example file path for a json: `log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`. Example event data:

    | key | value|  
    | :---: | :--- |
    | artist | "Pavement" |
    | auth | "LoggedIn" | 
    | firstName | "Sylvie" |
    | lastName | "Cruz" |
    | gender | "F" |
    | iteminSession | 0 |
    | duration | 99.16036 |
    | level | "free" |
    | location | "Washington-Arlington-Alexandria" | 
    | method | "PUT" |  
    | page | "NextSong" | 
    | registration | 1.540266e+12|
    | sessionId | 345 | 
    | song | "Mercy:The Laundromat" | 
    | status | 200 | 
    | ts | 1541990258796 |
    | userId | 53 |  

5. Source of raw data is stored in S3:
    - s3://udacity-dend/song_data
    - s3://udacity-dend/log_data
    - s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json


### How to run these workflows:
1. Run `>> python create_tables.py` on the terminal
2. Run `>> python etl.py` on the terminal
